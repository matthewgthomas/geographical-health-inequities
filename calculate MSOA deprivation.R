#' Calculate the Extent and population-weighted average scores for small areas

#' "Extent" is the proportion of the local population that live in areas classified as among the most deprived in the higher geography.
#' To calculate this, we need to first calculate a weighted score based on the population in the most deprived 30% of areas
